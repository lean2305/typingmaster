've added Google AdSense integration to your application. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

Sign up for Google AdSense if you haven't already at https://www.google.com/adsense

Once approved, replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID in both the index.html and Advertisement.tsx files with your actual AdSense publisher ID (it looks like "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")

Create ad units in your AdSense account and replace the slot props in the Advertisement components with your actual ad unit IDs

The advertisements have been strategically placed in:

Dashboard: Horizontal ad at the top and vertical ad in the sidebar
Landing page: Horizontal ad after the hero section and rectangular ad before the footer
Important notes:

Make sure your site complies with Google AdSense policies
Test the ads in production to ensure they display correctly
Consider user experience when placing ads - they shouldn't interfere with core functionality
Monitor ad performance through your AdSense dashboard
The Advertisement component is reusable, so you can easily add more ad placements by importing and using it in other components as needed.
